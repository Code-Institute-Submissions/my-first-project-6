## Description

People Matter! A saying you may find useful is: “If you’d like someone to do a big thing, ask them to do a little thing.” Bring people in, build a team, and encourage, thank and support each other at every stage.   

The direct and indirect impact that events have on communities are important in a number of different ways. They create a strong coming together for people from all walks of life, they provide opportunities for participation, volunteering and encourage involvement for all ages. Community involvement in events also provides social, cultural, economic and environmental development throughout to the surrounding areas, so is beneficial in many ways and important to ensure that community is the focal point of events.    

Community events contribute to keeping the spirit high for local residents within the community and have an impact on repeat visits on annual events. If an event provides activities that cater to a whole family and their friends, there is automatically going to be an increase in footfall numbers.  

Community activities are an important feature for bringing a connection into communities and for bringing people together, and for helping to create a support network and for building bonds and relationships.  

While many individuals and communities have long recognised the damage that can be caused to our environment and that of the plants and animals we share our planet with, it is only relatively recently this has been acknowledged globally. The air we breathe and our rivers and oceans don’t recognize local, national or even continental boundaries – so we must all take care of them for each other.  

The project aims at bringing people together to collectively engage in activities that are beneficial to the one another and the environment. The activities include but not limited to agroforestry, harnessing renewable sources of energy, improvng mental and physical health of the members of the community, setting up meditation centres, etc.

## Technologies Used

The basic technologies that have been used in the project are:

1. HTML -  the standard markup language for Web pages. With HTML you can create your own Website.  
2. CSS - HTML only gives you the skeletal framework of the website. However, CSS hepls you design the webpage, thereby giving you an array of styles, colors & formatting.  
3. Bootstrap - Bootstrap is a free and open-source CSS framework directed at responsive, mobile-first front-end web development. It contains CSS- and JavaScript-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation, and other interface components. It reduces the lines of the code that would have otherwise been required to style the website.  
4. GitHub - GitHuhs are commonly used to host open-source projects. It provides access control and several collaboration features such as bug tracking, feature requests, task management, continuous integration and wikis for every project.
